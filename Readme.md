The development of this one was driven by the need for a simple, yet effective Uptime Kuma Client for Windows. Also to make it accessable for all user levels without fiddeling with scripts, and yet having the option to use the push Monitor-Type behind a firewall for example.

By using push monitors you can monitor any servers that arenâ€™t reachable from the internet but are able to reach the internet. Servers behind a NAT, or having outgoing internet access only using a proxy for instance.
This client can be seen as a bridge to devices where you can't run, push notification scripts on themselves for example. But for sure can also be used if you don't want to hassle with a cron type of functionality or powershell script on windows.
